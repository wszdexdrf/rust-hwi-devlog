## Week 8
I keep working on automating the installation of rust-hwi and incorporate many insights given by other people in the project. I also add a major test which checks one of the most important aspect of the project, which is signing a transaction.
## Week 9
I get one of the first PR merged in the parent project BDK. This was a result of many steps of reviews, changes and iteration. I also take on a couple of other issues to fix while I am working on the last aspect of my project, which is integrating rust-hwi with BDK
## Week 10
I finally get a PR ready for integration of rust-hwi with BDK. I create a PR for the same and wait for reviews!
## Week 11
I got some more important insights about my PR for integration of rust-hwi with BDK. I open PRs for other issues I was working in BDK and keep working to incorporate suggestions. All tests are passing and the PRs will be merged soon!
